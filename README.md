# The Food Blog

The premise of this blog is to serve my friends.  I've come to a realization
that some of my good friends would love to explore more food spots in
Massachusetts.  The problem is fear and confusion.  It's not easy to find which
places are good to eat unless you get a recommendation. And even if you do
get a recommendation organizing a trip with friends could be quite difficult.

My site provides a means for my friends, the users, to see the interesting
places I have eaten or give a recommendation to where I should eat next.

## Blogger functionality

As a blogger, he or she must be able to have exclusive access to creating,
updating, and deleting entries and suggestions made by visitors.  The blogger
must also be able to list details about his or her experience at each
restaurant.  Attributes such as time, restaurant, date, dish, location, and
rating should be provide to give the visitors useful information.
Entries should be organized by date entered.

## Visitors to the Site

Vistors should be able to post a recommendation as well as make comments to
other recommendations and past entries.  Visitors should also be able to vote
on the recommendations.

## Additional features

The site is most definitely in pre-alpha stage.  Additional functionality
should be included in the long run. The features include a modal that populates
the data.  Pictures that are populated with each entry.  Visitors should also
be able to vote.
